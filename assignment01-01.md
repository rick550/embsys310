A device I am curious in is the embedded system of an everyday use passenger vehicle. 

Cars have many sensors in them which are used as inputs to help monitor the oil, tire pressure, fuel pump, oxygen, brakes just to name a few. My understanding
on how I think it may work lies mostly in the sensors themselves. The computer job is to determine what output the sensors are reading. I don't think the memory constraints
will be as the same as the telegraph example and that it will have more memory to work with.
